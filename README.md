# SystemVerilog Implementation of Keccak

## Keccak Modules for X-HEEP and SHA-3 Integration

This repository contains two different Keccak-related SystemVerilog modules, each targeting a specific use case.

- **`keccak_f.sv`** : this is the standalone Keccak-f permutation core, designed to be integrated directly into the X-HEEP platform.
- **`keccak.sv`** : it implements the full SHA-3 hashing algorithm using the Keccak-f permutation. It includes `keccak_buffer.sv`.


## Notes

- The design has been updated to use only 50 32-bit registers of in/out (keccak_reg_top.sv). ⚠️IMPORTANT⚠️
 keccak_reg_top.sv has been automatically generated by reggen and then modified to use the 50 registers as both input and output registers.
- The OBI interface is not used in the wrapper, so the distinction between ctrl and data registers is not necessary.
